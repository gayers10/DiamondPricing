# DiamondPricing
Developed a regression-based pricing model to optimize valuation strategies and improve pricing transparency in the diamond market. Built a predictive model using key diamond characteristics (carat, cut, depth, table, and color), achieving a 90% accuracy rate in price estimation. Identified and removed multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis, ensuring model reliability.
Implemented forward, backward, and stepwise selection techniques to refine the model, enhancing pricing precision.
